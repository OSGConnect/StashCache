## Usage

```
stashcp [-d] [-r] [-h] -s <source> [-l <location to be copied to>]

-d: show debugging information
-r: recursively copy
-h: show this help text
	
--closest: return closest cache location

Exit status 4 indicates that at least one file did not successfully copy over.
Exit status 1 indicates that the WantsStashCache classad was not present in job environment.
```

## Overview of algorithm 

All the functions are defined above everything else, so the code is not simple to read.  STASHCP itself starts "running" after the comment line `### LOGIC TO RUN STASHCP ###`.

### Startup
Before any downloading happens, STASHCP checks for relevant classads, loads xrootd, initializes information variables and processes arguments.  It also determines the closest local cache.

#### Classads
In order to make sure that StashCache jobs are only sent to those sites that can handle them, users are required to add a StashCache classad to their jobs: `+WantsStashCache = true`

If that classad is not present, STASHCP will stop, return 1, and print out an error message.

**Note:** This classad is not required if STASHCP is being run interactively, i.e., outside of a job environment.

#### Information variables
The information variables are shell arrays holding strings corresponding to the start and end times of downloads, as well as the file or folder name and the size.  At the end of STASHCP, the information variables will be turned into strings and set as classads for the job.  Right now, because HTCondor limits classads to 1024 characters, the strings are truncated.

When a directory is downloaded, the information variables will be updated as if the directory were a single unit - the filename variable will hold just the directory path, the size will reflect the size of the directory, and the download times will reflect the downloading time for the directory.  This improves legibility and reduces space requirements.  If a user downloads a directory `mydir`, the information variable for filename will hold `mydir+`.  If a user downloads `mydir/`, the information variable for filename will hold `mydir/+`.

#### Arguments
STASHCP only requires a single argument, the source.  Every other argument is optional.
* `-s <source>` : `<source>` is the *comma-delimited* list of files and/or directories that the user wishes to download.  The path of a given file will be of the form `user/<username>/public/<path in STASH>`.
* `-l <location>` : `<location>` is the location within the job directory that the user wishes to download their files/directories to.  This can only be a single location.  If the directory does not exist when STASHCP is run, STASHCP will fail and return 1.
* `-d` : if this flag is present, print debugging information.
* `-r` : if this flag is present, download recursively (all subfolders).

#### Local cache
Simply calls `setStashCache.sh` and holds the result.  The called code uses geoip information and the `caches.json` file to determine to closest active cache.

### Main Loop
This loop iterates over every file/directory that the user wishes to download.  Each of these items is referred to as a source item.

Before any downloading occurs, STASHCP checks to see if the source currently being examined is a file or a directory.  If the source is a file, [`doStashCpSingle`](#doStashCpSingle) is called; otherwise, [`doStashCpDirectory`](#doStashCpDirectory) is called.  The source item is downloaded to the user-specified directory.  In both cases, a flag is set to indicate that the information variables are to be updated with respect to the source being downloaded.


#### Location Logic

Due to numerous problems with trying to do this recursively, I decided to take a more direct approach and have STASHCP use the full source file path to direct location logic.

Simply speaking, STASHCP swaps out the prefix in the full path of the source item (the source prefix, denoted in the code as `$prefixRm`) for the prefix that the downloaded item should have in the job space).  That prefix is set per original source argument in the main loop.  The job prefix is a little more complicated, consisting of a base directory (the user-specified location) and a local path (defined as the source path with `$prefixRm` removed from the beginning).  The `$prefixRm` and `$baseDir` variables are defined at the source level within the main loop, and the `$localPath` variable is defined individually for each file within `doStashCpSingle` or `doStashCpDirectory`.  The ultimate command is this: `xrdcp $xrdargs -f $sourcePrefix://$downloadFile $baseDir/$localPath` 

This can be better understood in the examination of a few different cases.  In every case, the user-specified location is the home directory, and so `$loc=.`  `$sourcePrefix` is just the location of the closest cache.  The `xrdcp` commands are simplified for legibility.
* The source item is a file `user/jsmith/public/data.dat`.
  - `$downloadFile = user/jsmith/public/data.dat`
  - `$prefixRm = user/jsmith/public/` 
  - `$baseDir = .`
  - `$localPath = data.dat`
  - Command: `xrdcp $sourcePrefix://user/jsmith/public/data.dat ./data.dat`
* The source item is a directory `user/jsmith/public/folderA`, and STASHCP is downloading a file `A1.dat` from `folderA`.
  - `$downloadFile = user/jsmith/public/folderA/A1.dat`
  - `$prefixRm = user/jsmith/public/folderA/`
  - `$baseDir = ./folderA`
  - `$localPath = A1.dat`
  - Command: `xrdcp $sourcePrefix://user/jsmith/public/folderA/A1.dat folderA/A1.dat`
* The source item is a directory `user/jsmith/public/folderB`, and STASHCP is downloading a file `beta1.dat` from one of its subdirectories `beta`.
  - `$downloadFile = user/jsmith/public/folderB/beta/beta1.dat`
  - `$prefixRm = user/jsmith/public/folderB`
  - `$baseDir = ./folderB`
  - `$localPath = beta/beta1.dat`
  - Command: `xrdcp $sourcePrefix://user/jsmith/public/folderB/beta/beta1.dat folderB/beta/beta1.dat`

#### doStashCpSingle
This is where all the downloading actually happens.

This function can take two arguments.  The first one, which is required, is the name of the file to be downloaded.  If the second argument is present, the function will update the information variables with information about this particular file download.  If the second argument is not present, no updating of information variables occurs (such as when the file being downloaded is but one member of a larger directory being downloaded).

`doStashCpSingle` depends on another script, [`downloading_timeout.sh`](#downloading_timeoutsh) for all timeout logic.

`doStashCpSingle` attempts to run `xrdcp` from the local cache, keeping track of start and end time.  If this pull is not successful, a second `xrdcp` from local is attempted.  Should that pull fail, STASHCP fails over to pulling from the trunk, and failover information is updated.  If the final pull is not successful, failure information is updated.  However, if any pull is successful, the usual information variables are updated.  Furthermore, information about the successful download is uploaded to our Hadoop machine.

#### doStashCpDirectory
Like [`doStashCpSingle`](#dostashcpsingle), this function can take two arguments - the first is the directory to be downloaded, and the second is a flag to let the function know if it should update information.  Information should not be updated if the directory being currently downloaded is a subdirectory of a larger directory being downloaded.

`doStashCpDirectory` iterates through the contents of the input directory.  If an item is a file, `doStashCpSingle` is called on the item.  If the item is a directory, and the recursive flag `-r` has been set, then the appropriate directory is created (look for the `## creating local directory for subfolder` comment) and `doStashCpDirectory` is called on the item recursively.   The time it takes to iterate and download all of the contents is recorded and, if appropriate, updated to the information variables.

### Finishing
The information variables are chirped, as described [above](#information-variables).

If any single download failed, STASHCP itself has failed.  In this case, STASHCP returns 4.

### downloading_timeout.sh
This is a separate script that tracks the size of a file being downloaded, and cuts off the download command if the file's size does not change enough in a given period of time.  This helps to tell the difference between a stalled download and a slow download.

Usage: `downloading_timeout.sh -t <TIMEOUT> -d <DIFF> -f <FILE> -s <EXPSIZE> <DOWNLOADING COMMAND>`

The script waits at most `$timeout` seconds until `$file` exists, at which point it stores `$prevSize`, the size of the file in bytes.  If `$file` does not exist after `$timeout` seconds, the command stops.  Every `$timeout` seconds, the script computes the expected size of the file using `$prevSize`, `$expSize` and `$diff`: `$wantSize := min($prevSize + $diff, $expSize)`.  Thus, the script is asking for at least an increase of `$diff` bytes, unless `$prevSize + $diff > $expSize`.  If the file size has not increased appropriately, the script shuts down the downloading command.

It is recommended that `$timeout` not be set to 1 second, as tests showed that download times varied on a second-by-second level.  A better value is in the range of 3-10 seconds.  These variables are set in STASHCP.

## Known issues and concerns 

* Relies on GEOIP to find closest cache
  - GEOIP doesn't always work
  - Closest cache isn't necessarily the best cache
  - No checking for "next-closest" cache if closest cache is temporarily down and status is not yet reflected in caches.json
	
* Call could be simpler, without requiring the use of flags for every argument
  - Want: `stashcp <FILE> <LOCATION> <FLAGS>`
  - Have: `stashcp -s <FILE> -l <LOCATION> <FLAGS>`
	
* Static hard-coded number of attempts to pull from cache (2) and trunk (1)
  - Does not take type of error/failure into account
  - If the closest cache is the trunk, then the algorithm will attempt to pull from the trunk 3 times, instead of 1 or 2
	
* Relies explicitly on the trunk being up in order to run critical steps
  - In particular, relies on trunk being up in order to get size of file or to get contents of directory
  - Could lead to unnecessary failure when the trunk is down but files are already present and accounted for on closest cache
	
* Does not do anything else if STASHCP fails
  - Maybe if STASHCP from the local cache and from the trunk fail, should try wget?  Hard to think of a situation when wget would work but stashcp from the trunk would not.
  - Relatedly, STASHCP returns failure even if only one file isn't downloaded.  We should consider breaking out of STASHCP immediately upon failure.
	
* Error messages are not informative for users
  - Messages written only for the coder to use
  
* Hadoop messages still rely on timeout utility, which may not be available on all sites.
  - On the other hand, the sites that don't have timeout are likely to be troublemakers in other ways, and would not support STASHCP for many other reasons.

* STASHCP assumes the following:
  * The Owner ClassAd is present and not Undefined
  * The ProjectName ClassAd exists

* STASHCP does not transfer files back from the worker node

* No record of whether the file was new to the cache it was pulled from or not

* Does not currently allow for file renaming.
