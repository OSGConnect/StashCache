stashcache Description
----------

This script is used as an intermediary between a condor_master and a StashCache
cache server. Its two main functions are to accept signals from the
condor_master and to advertise the cache stats back to the master. It is not
intended to be run standalone but rather by the condor_master. It calls
xrootd_cache_stats.py to query the XRootD cache.

Invoking xrootd_cache_stats.py
----------
This is a script for collecting information about the files in a Stash cache and formatting them as an HTCondor classad.

If run as

xrootd_cache_stats.py <base xrootd URL> <top level cache directory> [max cache fraction]

it will print the classad to stdout

for example

xrootd_cache_stats.py root://fermicloud126.fnal.gov /stash 0.9

The max cache fraction is needed to correctly calculate the remaining cache size.
It should match the value in the xrootd config file.
